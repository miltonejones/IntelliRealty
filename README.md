Here are some more details about the functions in the real estate assistant app interface:

- `render_sidebar()`: This draws the left sidebar with navigation options like selecting a city, listing, and chatbot settings. It handles setting up the session state variables.

- `main()`: The main function that brings together all the components. It initializes the session, renders the sidebar, sets up the chatbot, loads the listing documents, and handles the chat UI.

- `get_document_list()`: Loads the PDF listing files from the `src` folder and creates a dictionary mapping clean names to file paths. It optionally filters by city.

- `load_source_documents()`: Creates a FAISS document store from the PDF listing files to power retrieval.

- `load_description()`: Uses the conversation chain to generate a property description in JSON format for a given listing PDF. Caches the result to avoid re-generating each time.

- `load_source_document()`: Loads a single PDF into a FAISS document store for faster chat retrieval.

- `save_uploaded_file()`: Handles saving a new uploaded PDF to the `src` folder and processing it.

- `initialize_session()`: Sets up initial state for streamlit session variables.

- `truncate_string()`: Trims long listing names for the sidebar selection UI.

- `blank_page()`: Renders the main content area. Has tabs for property details and editing. Displays the map.

- `property_view_panel()`: Shows the listing details and description.

- `create_table()`: Generates a Markdown table from the floor plan data.

- `property_edit_form()`: Allows editing the listing data. Saves back to the JSON file.

- `delete_pdf_and_json_files()`: Deletes the PDF, JSON, and FAISS index for a listing.
